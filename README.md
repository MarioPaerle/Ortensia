Ortensia is a Game I wanna realize, from soundtracks, to graphics, and of course gameplay.
Ortensia will feature small lightweight libraries that will help me, and maybe others develop games.
- Graphic (CPU Bounded simple yet fast visual effects)
- Animations
- Automatic Music Scoring
- Lightweigh AI NPCs
It aims to make simple game development easy wrapping pygame-ce.
It will support simple graphic effects, with quality adjustment, all CPU computed leveraging 
numpy vectorized operations.
Collision grids are being developed.
Simple GUIs creation as well.

# Examples
**Ortensia** can support high frame rate (400+ on intel 5 12th), here are two examples working on mid and low settings,
using the Bloom effect and a Particle Emitter

GIF quality is of course very bad, but you can imagine come on

### Mid Quality Bloom:
