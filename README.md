# Ortensia

> [!WARNING]
> Ortensia is just born, so its full of bug, and misses a documentation

Ortensia is a small lightweight library am developing primarly for myself.
It aims to make simple game development easy wrapping pygame-ce.
It will support simple graphic effects, with quality adjustment, all CPU computed leveraging 
numpy vectorized operations.
Collision grids are being developed.
Simple GUIs creation as well.

# Examples
**Ortensia** can support high frame rate (400+ on intel 5 12th), here are two examples working on mid and low settings,
using the Bloom effect and a Particle Emitter

### Mid Quality Bloom:
